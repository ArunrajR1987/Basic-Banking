## Optimize and refactor secure password handling implementation

### Changes made:

1. **Code refactoring in AuthController**:
   - Extracted duplicate code into reusable methods
   - Created helper methods for password handling, customer creation, and response generation
   - Improved error handling and response consistency
   - Fixed parameter naming for consistency (authrequest â†’ authRequest)

2. **Enhanced PasswordSecurityUtil**:
   - Added constants for algorithm name and key size
   - Implemented proper logging with SLF4J
   - Improved exception handling with more descriptive messages
   - Added documentation comments

3. **Optimized SecurityController**:
   - Added HTTP caching for the public key endpoint
   - Set cache control headers to reduce unnecessary requests
   - Improved response type safety with generic type parameters

4. **Documentation improvements**:
   - Added detailed flow diagram to README.md
   - Documented data flow and object transformations
   - Visualized client-server interactions for secure password handling

### Benefits:

- **Reduced code duplication**: Extracted common functionality into reusable methods
- **Improved maintainability**: Better organization and separation of concerns
- **Enhanced security**: More robust error handling for encrypted passwords
- **Better performance**: Added caching for public key endpoint
- **Clearer documentation**: Visual representation of system architecture and data flow

This commit completes the implementation of secure password handling with proper code organization, error handling, and documentation.
